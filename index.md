# Liquid Glass Compose: A Glassmorphism Library for Jetpack Compose âœ¨

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-v1.0.0-blue)](https://github.com/andrea60727/liquid-glass-compose/releases)

## Overview

Liquid Glass Compose is a powerful library designed for Jetpack Compose, bringing the beauty of glassmorphism to your Android applications. This library leverages AGSL shaders to create stunning visual effects, including blur, distortion, shadows, and more. It is optimized for Android 13 and above, making it a modern choice for developers looking to enhance their UI.

### Features

- **Blur Effects**: Create soft, blurred backgrounds that enhance readability and aesthetics.
- **Distortion**: Apply various distortion effects to your UI elements, adding depth and dimension.
- **Shadows**: Incorporate realistic shadows that elevate your components and create a layered look.
- **Customizable**: Adjust parameters to suit your design needs easily.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal impact on performance, ensuring smooth user experiences.

## Getting Started

To start using Liquid Glass Compose, follow these steps:

### Installation

Add the dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.andrea60727:liquid-glass-compose:1.0.0'
}
```

### Usage

To use the library, simply import the necessary components and apply them to your UI elements. Here's a basic example:

```kotlin
import com.andrea60727.liquidglasscompose.*

@Composable
fun GlassCard() {
    LiquidGlassCard(
        modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp),
        blurRadius = 10.dp,
        shadowColor = Color.Black.copy(alpha = 0.2f)
    ) {
        Text("Hello, Glassmorphism!", style = MaterialTheme.typography.h6)
    }
}
```

### Example Project

Check out the example project in the repository to see the library in action. You can find various use cases and configurations that demonstrate the full potential of Liquid Glass Compose.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Shaders

You can create custom shaders to achieve unique effects. Hereâ€™s a simple example of how to implement a custom shader:

```kotlin
val customShader = Shader(
    // Your AGSL shader code here
)
```

### Performance Optimization

Liquid Glass Compose is designed with performance in mind. However, you can further optimize your application by:

- Limiting the use of blur effects in large components.
- Reducing the number of layers using glassmorphism.
- Testing on different devices to ensure smooth performance.
